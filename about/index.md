Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool, originally developed by IBM Emerging Technology Services team and now a part of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

            <h3>Browser-based flow editing</h3>
            <p>Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed to the runtime in a single-click.</p>
            <p>JavaScript functions can be created within the editor using a rich text editor.</p>
            <p>A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.</p>

            <h3>Built on Node.js</h3>
            <p>The light-weight runtime is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud.</p>
            <p>It is easy to extend the range of palette nodes to add new capabilities, with over <a href="https://flows.nodered.org">5000 nodes</a> already shared by the community.</p>

            <h3>Social Development</h3>
            <p>The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others.</p>
            <p>An online <a href="https://flows.nodered.org" target="_blank">flow library</a> allows you to share your best flows with the world.</p>

### History

Node-RED started life in early 2013 as a side-project by Nick O'Leary and Dave
Conway-Jones of IBM's Emerging Technology Services group.

What began as a proof-of-concept for visualising and manipulating mappings
between MQTT topics, quickly became a much more general tool for building light-weight,
event-driven applications.


Open-sourced in September 2013, Node-RED was one of the founding projects of the JS Foundation
in October 2016. In 2019, the Node.js Foundation merged with the JS Foundation to form the
[OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

In 2021, Nick founded <a href="https://flowfuse.com">FlowFuse, Inc.</a> to continue
driving Node-RED forward, making it more accessible for enterprise use. FlowFuse was
created to elevate Node-RED for enterprise contexts through a secure, professional,
and scalable platform and has found particular success in industrial applications
helping teams connect, collect, transform and visualize operational data.

<div class="doc-callout">
<b>Why is it called Node-RED?</b> The name was a light-hearted play on words
sounding like 'Code Red'. It stuck and was a great improvement on whatever it was
called in the first few days.

The 'Node' part reflects both the flow/node programming model as well as the
underlying Node.JS runtime. We never did come to a conclusion
on what the 'RED' part stands for. "Rapid Event Developer" was one suggestion,
but we've never felt compelled to formalise anything.

We stick with 'Node-RED'.
